My name is Carlos Madeira and I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1962.

Iâ€™m interested in everything web, end-to-end. I have been dealing since 1997 with successive generations of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

I created (end-to-end, including webdesign, logos and other images) some of the biggest websites in Portugal, for a webportal that was closed around 2015.
You may be able to find them on some archive: http://viajar.clix.pt and http://animais.clix.pt

I created several public websites that for some reason were abandoned, like http://webmusix.net, http://websaude.net, http://webconstroi.net, http://webescola.net, http://biztravels.net, http://portugal-hotels.com, http://turbrasil.com, http://montra.net, http://promov.net and many others.

I also created several private web apps to solve specific problems for friends and family, including a Notes system, a mini-Facebook (there was no Facebook then) for a university professor to have his doctoral students share ideas and documents. This professor retired around 2012, the app was deleted.

I created some private web apps to use as cellphone magic tricks. Of course, this cannot be shared.

I am familiar with Angular, ReactJS, SASS, Python, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, NodeJS, what else?

I am working since April 2023 on Javra.com, using Pimcore and Symphony.

I had spent the previous 40 years of my life (1982-2022) working as a journalist, and from 1983 to 1998 as editor of top national weekly magazines.

In 1998, I launched, as editor, the first (monthly) science magazine in Portugal, "Super Interessante", which I had to abandon in March 2022 due to insurpassable differences with the publishing house.

I read, speak and write fluent Portuguese, English, Spanish and French.
